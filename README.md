# tramigo

Hi, I've created this project in response to question 3 for the tramigo technical task.

Steps completed so far: 

- [x] 3.1. Configure the Laravel app to connect to the database from item #1.
- [x] 3.2. Use the command `php artisan make:command Tracking` to create a console
     command in Laravel. This should add a file Tracking.php in
     Laravel/app/Console/Commands/Tracking.php
- [ ] 3.3. Edit Tracking.php, such that when executing the command
     `php artisan track`, the script queries devices and corresponding reports
     from the database and dumps them to the screen.
